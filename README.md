In today's competitive streaming services, data-driven insights are crucial for businesses like Netflix to thrive. The Netflix dashboard project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of user behaviour and content consumption patterns, enabling informed decision-making across various aspects of the business.

The project focuses on five keys objectives:

- Analyse trends in content consumption over time
- Assess performance of different content categories
- Explore global content diversity and regional preferences
- Identify popular genres
- Uncover patterns in user ratings

By assessing all these key objectives, the project intends to generate actionable insights. These insights, derived from a mix of analytical techniques such as descriptive, time series, comparative, and geospatial analysis, can significantly influence content strategy, marketing initiatives, and user experience optimisation.

The project draws upon a variety of data sources, including viewing data, rating data, and demographic data, to fuel its analytical work. Data visualisations, a crucial element in translating raw data into understandable representations, are strategically employed. Charts, graphs, and maps are utilised to present insights in an accessible and engaging manner, facilitating senior management's grasp of patterns and trends.

The Netflix dashboard project has delivered valuable insights into viewer preferences, content consumption patterns, and regional trends. These insights are providing Netflix with a roadmap for future success, helping the company to continue to deliver engaging and popular content to its global audience.
